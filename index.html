            <p1>Hi! I'm Sophie, I'm currently taking part in the Clickstart course at Bath Spa. I have experience with
              building websites, and I'm excited to be learning even more! I'm a creative, hardworking, and driven
              person who loves to explore new skills and meet new people. I live near Bath and am looking for
              opportunities - remote or local - to work with people who share my passion for creativity and problem
              solving.
            </p1>
